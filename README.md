StaticMapMaker
==============

A PNG map maker for OpenStreetMap and similar tile servers


History
=======

This is a fork of StaticMap (<http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StaticMap>).  StaticMap's last major update was in 2009, and since then, some tile servers have gone offline and others have come online.

StaticMap was written largely by Ojw (<http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Ojw>).  The source code for that project is available via Subversion at <http://svn.openstreetmap.org/sites/other/StaticMap/>.  This project is based on a clone of Changeset 16648 (Revision 29820).

When asked about the license for StaticMap on Twitter, Ojw said the source code could be considered BSD-licensed.

    Dear @almien, I've been playing around with #StaticMap recently. Very fun! Is it freely licensed? I looked at the source but dunno. #OSM

    @dpp0 you're welcome to treat http://svn.openstreetmap.org/sites/other/StaticMap/ â€¦ as BSD-licensed, I'll try to update those files at some point.
